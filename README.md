## Project Title

Iowa City Arrest Dashboard

## Description

We were tasked with creating a dashboard from the Iowa City Police website, which was initially created in Excel and imported into Google Sheets. The dashboard uses slicers and graphs to show users the most frequent charges, most frequent locations, most frequent times of the day for crimes, and most frequent day of the week for crimes.
